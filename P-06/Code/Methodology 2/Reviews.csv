0,"This is my first cell phone. I only needed something to forward my home phone to. No interest in email, texting, photography, etc. What I find amusing is the price. I got this at a T-Mobile store in April for $49.00.Then I recently saw it on sale"" at Target stores for $69! HERE  it's $99! Wow!Want to buy minutes? Go to Ebay! I got 1000 for a year for $90! Can't beat it. I LOVE this little bugger!"" ",positive
1,"I have to agree that this phone is a great basic phone. Talking to people they don't guess it is a cell phone until I switch to speaker. Even then they can understand me/us well and we can all hear the speaker clearly as well. It is stylish looking with a nice little screen. The menu has nice icons with good animations and the predictive text function works flawlessly. For my next phone, in a year or so, I'll look into cameras, bluetooth, etc but for now this phone seems like a sturdy little good performer that doesn't break the bank. I only gave it 4 stars because it is missing some of those features but if all you want is a phone with texting this is a five star phone.Keep in mind if you want T-mobile to Go and use lots of text messages to pay the extra monthly fee ($5 for 400 msgs or $10 for 1000) or you'll go through your minutes very quickly. And, believe me, with the predictive text function texting is a breeze and fun to do. I'll never use another phone without it! Also, I like that I can have my email forwarded to my phone as a text message without worrying that several spam a day are going to break me.",positive
2,"I've owned my t219 for about 18 months now, and overall I am happy with it. This is a very basic phone: no camera, no bluetooth. I've been most happy with reception: I get a strong signal at work and at home. Of course, your experience will depend entirely on where you live and work! I have no complaints about the ringtones: I purchased a basic ring tone (though I wish it had been included), and I don't mind the default alerts for voice and text messages. The ringtones are plenty loud, and I like the vibrate-then-ring setting. It's easy to switch back and forth between regular and vibrate modes.Voice quality has been fine. I've never had a complaint at my end or from the person I'm talking to, except when I'm outside on a windy day. That's been problem with any cell phone I've owned, so I don't hold it against this one.The buttons are nice, with a good tactile feel so you know when they're pressed. They've held up well. The phone as a whole has held up well over 18 months, with a few nicks and scratches, but still feeling completely solid. It smudges a lot, but that's a minor complaint.My old phone had a game or two to addict me (yay blackjack!). This one has a few games but none of them held any interest for me. A couple were demos that try and entice me to purchase the full game. Forget it! But no one's buying this phone for the games, anyway.The phone also supports Instant Messaging, but I haven't used that feature so I won't evaluate it in this review.So what's the major flaw? The proprietary headset jack. It's a flat connector that doubles as the charger and headset jack. Samsung sells an in-the-ear bud that has the right connector. It might work for some people, but I can't keep the thing in my ear -- it just falls out! So I went to look for over-the-ear options. There are a few third-party headsets that claim to work with the t219, and they have the flat connector -- but don't bother. They don't work. There must be something proprietary about the way Samsung's headsets work -- or there's a flaw in the design. You can hear the beeps and boops when you press buttons, but there's no audio for the calls themselves. I went through several third-party headsets before giving up and going back to the Samsung earbuds. So, bottom line: don't expect to find any over-the-ear or other third party headsets for this phone.Although I like this phone in every other aspect, if I'd known about the headset problem I probably would have purchased some other phone.In the end, I do recommend this phone for people who want something basic, and who don't mind being stuck with Samsung's only option for a headset.",positive
3,THank you Amazon.com for your excellent service. Ordering a cell phone thru your website is very easy. The phone is what I expected.The whole process was easy and simple. Thank you.,positive
4,"I currently have this item for my S/E z500a phone. Though it doesn't seem to work yet, I will say that Electro Island is working with me on a daily basis to get it up and running...More to follow. This vendor has some of the best and most polite service I've encountered from an online purchase.",positive
5,"Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.",negative
6,"If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.",negative
7,"The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back. I don't know if they are all that way (maybe I got a bad one?), but I didn't want to buy another one to find out.",negative
8,Description read 3.5 mm male to 2.5 mm female. WRONG it was the completely opposite!,negative
9,I matched this up with my LG Venus and a pair of Koss Pro headphones and it doesn't work properly as it cuts out the left channel.,negative
